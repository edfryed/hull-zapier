# Hull ♥ Zapier

Zapier is a service for piping data between your tools (over 750 integrations) with filters, saving you having to build manual integrations.

Zapier can pass all different forms of data, but doesn’t store data when passing “Zaps”.

Hull let’s you manage and manipulate the data that Segment is piping around between it’s catalog of 750+ tools. You can combine and collect data from multiple sources, then sort, score and segment that data before sharing and syncing it with other tools - including Zapier for Zapping it the 750+ other tools.

You won’t be constrained by each own tools own filter options and native integrations, by the capabilities of Zapier zaps (individually, or collectively), or by technical limitations:

- No APIs to tap into
- No code needed
- No import/export
- No complexity
- No repetitive workflow creation

If you’re used to stringing many Zaps together in one workflow, you’ll love being able to transparently manage, replicate and maintain those workflows in Zapier.


####  To install:

- Go to Zapier, create new Zap.
- Copy the webhook url and paste it in your Hull Ship's Customize page.
- You're done.
